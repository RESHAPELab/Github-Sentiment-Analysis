"I don't have a very strong opinion on this. Long-term I'd say it would be good to allow accents in hashtags as it feels more inclusive. But for now let's just go with the easiest solution? Or is this something we need to decide now because we already have hashtags with accents?"
"The main reason why it's not very readable is the way how it's written. Look at this modified test:
it('handles natively translated strings -- with several parameters', () => {
   const translationId = 'hotels.gallery.pagination';
   const translatedString = '%1$@ of %2$@';
   expect(getTranslation(translatedString, translationId)).toBe(
     '__1_photoNumber__ of __2_totalPhotos__',
   );
});
So the question must be asked: where is the photoNumber and totalPhotos comming from? As you can see it's pretty magic so you have to dig deep in order to uderstand it. Better way how to implement it would be to accept the vocabulary as an argument which means larger refactoring. The tests would be very obvious though after this change."

"Anda bisa jadi mengandalkan useMemo sebagai salah satu optimasi performa, bukan sebagai jaminan semantic. Di masa yang akan datang, React bisa saja memilih untuk ""forget"" beberapa nilai-nilai hasil memoize sebelumnya dan menghitung ulang pada render selanjutnya, contohnya untuk mengosongkan memori dari komponen-komponen offscreen. Tulis kode Anda agar kode tersebut dapat terus berjalan tanpa useMemo — dan menambahkannya ke performa yang teroptimasi. (Untuk kasus yang langka ketika sebuah nilai harus tidak pernah dikomputasi ulang, Anda bisa menginisiasi secara lazy (initialize lazily) sebuah ref.)

Our code is actually agnostic to the variable names you assign them to, as far as I understand anyway. So therefore if you want to use it with another library you would have to specify that option, as we never check for variables called styled I believe.
In that case the argument here and the option name should probably be libraryName, yeah?"

"Based on #1876 (comment), here are the changes applied:

Killed contribute for contribution flow routes that don't have a tier

Impact: If collectives have linked to these routes, they'll now end up on the tiers page instead
Example: /babel/contribute => Babel Tiers page


Moved all tier routes for contribution flow

From_/:collective/:verb/tier/:tierId-:tierSlug
To___/:collective/contribute/:tierSlug-:tierId/checkout
Example: /babel/donate/tier/42-blabla => /babel/contribute/blabla-42/checkout
Impact: Older routes will still work but they're marked as deprecated in the code




Which gives the following routing table:

/babel/contribute => tiers page
/babel/contribute/blabla-42 => tier page for tier 42
/babel/contribute/blabla-42/checkout => contribution flow for tier 42
/babel/donate => contribution flow to donate without a tier


If we're good with this (I am) then I'll follow up in another issue for us to watch the logs and kill the unused routes after some time."

Within the context of the test, we will never see the additional activity properties within the calls to the telemetryClient, as they are not pushed in. This is because it is the responsibility of the telemetryClient itself to grab the activity from the correlationContext and add them to the outgoing app insights events within the addBotIdentifiers method, after it has one of the Track methods called

                   assert(callCount < 7 && callCount > 0); 
        
    
  




Testing TelemetryLoggerMiddleware is not called is the flag is false.


Testing for the correlation context being disabled (as you suggested).


What I don't think I can test (and what I think you were suggesting we should) is that the correlation properties are added to the outgoing telemetry activity sent to the TrackEvent method.  We can't do this because it is the TelemetryClient itself that adds the additional properties from the stored activity.  As we are working with mock telemetry client and a mock app Insights + context, I think the most we can test is that we are storing the correct activity, it is refreshed each time and that we do call the logging middleware if enabled.
Ultimately, I am unsure what additional check you are suggesting, would you be able to clarify please?"

The reason we weren't using flags for the LocaleSwitch is for this very reason... I would say we should add the Buttons with the country code, like we do in LocaleSwitch... flags are prettier for sure, but there are many questions of which flag to show for which language, certainly the Brazil flag makes much more sense for Portuguese, no?"

"regarding the StackNavigator and history--basically I see it like this: if you deep-link, u probably should wipe previous history state, but if not, just always remember exactly where the user was. I much prefer that experience over starting over again like most apps do.
Regarding the overkill stuff, the  history state plus memory memoryHistory is basically an object with an array. So the only overkill is the views like StackNavigator itself, which you need anyway.
Otherwise I think in the React Navigation docs I discuss how to do back handling--basically drown the routes of each of your Stack Routers (i.e. stack navigators). That's the most fool proof way to do it. There is some manual work--and it's a good thing--it allows u to configure logic on what routes should be drained first and in what order.
...actually it looks like i dont discuss it. But basically in the handler u use for your BackHandler, dispatch a React Navigation action with the nav key of the corresponding StackRouter you want to drain, and intertwine such actions with actions to close drawers, and shift tabs. Shifting tabs will likely happen from backing out of the stack router attached to it. I gotta pattern for this that is super nice. I wish I documented it. crap."

"@kuba-- I really miss a good description in issues.

I agree that we also need far more effort in proper issue descriptions. But an issue description does not replace commit or pull request message. If the issue is properly written, then it can serve as much more detailed context as well as related discussion. The pull request/commit still benefits from a problem statement though.

the good PR's description is description how it was implemented

What and why still apply. What did you do to solve an issue and how? Why it was solved in a certain way and not in a different way? Even with well-defined issues, the exact scope of a given change, rationale of the ""how"", caveats, and so on, are not necessarily present in the issue in a concise way."

"@tbergq I don't know man. Are you sure you are not doing something dodgy there? We should always get the date in the UTC format (at least from our GraphQL):
{
  ""data"": {
    ""allFlights"": {
      ""edges"": [
        {
          ""node"": {
            ""arrival"": {
              ""localTime"": ""2018-08-10T00:40:00.000Z"",
              ""time"": ""2018-08-10T05:40:00.000Z""
            },
            ""departure"": {
              ""localTime"": ""2018-08-08T23:55:00.000Z"",
              ""time"": ""2018-08-08T21:55:00.000Z""
            }
          }
        },
...
It's defined by the DateTime type in GraphQL:

A date-time string at UTC, such as 2007-12-03T10:15:30Z, compliant with the date-time format outlined in section 5.6 of the RFC 3339 profile of the ISO 8601 standard for representation of dates and times using the Gregorian calendar.

So this is why it's so important to call the Intl with UTC timezone (so it will stay in UTC and it won't be converted into local timezone):
Intl.DateTimeFormat('en', {timeZone: 'UTC', year: 'numeric', month: 'numeric', day: 'numeric', hour: 'numeric', minute: 'numeric'}).format(new Date('2018-08-10T00:40:00.000Z'))
> ""8/10/2018, 12:40 AM""   (correct)

BUT

Intl.DateTimeFormat('en', {year: 'numeric', month: 'numeric', day: 'numeric', hour: 'numeric', minute: 'numeric'}).format(new Date('2018-08-10T00:40:00.000Z'))
> ""8/10/2018, 2:40 AM""   (WTF? It's not true...)

"@PrP-11 No, you got it wrong. Sorry I didn't put it clearly. The second screenshot of my review is misleading about username. 😅 I didn't mean that it's working on password tab but not on account tab. I tried logging out and then logging in again several times. Sometimes my username is displayed and sometimes it's not. Although I do see it if I switch tabs or refresh the page. This can be because username is fetched from server but not rendered in DOM sometimes here and when I change the tab, react looks for all the changes in virtual DOM and then renders them.

Seems like css prop was removed in rebassjs/grid@2667fa6
Pull request comment said:

The css prop should now be handled with either babel-plugin-styled-components or babel-plugin-emotion

The thing is: we already use babel-plugin-styled-components. We'll have to investigate further.

Back to my original desire to let this provide a useful way to limit what can assume a particular role, there are potentially a lot of values that will sanitize to the same thing. On the other hand, the repo owner controls all of these values, so they can keep them clean if they want to.
Maybe just add something to the readme warning of this?"
